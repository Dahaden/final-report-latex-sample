For a common set of real and synthetic image sequences, we report the results of a number of regularly cited optical flow techniques, including instances of differential, matching, energy-based and phase-based methods. Our comparisons are primarily empirical, and concentrate on the accuracy, reliability and density of the velocity measurements; they show that...}},
